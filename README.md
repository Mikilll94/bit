# Bit

Bit is a tool for connecting repositories through shared components.  

It unlocks the development and composition of modern applications from independent components, which can be independent developed and integrated into many projects. Bit's rich and extendable toolset, with a visual UI, creates an enjoyable developer experience for every step of modular development. ¬†

The [component cloud platform](https://bit.dev/) is a component marketplace as-a-service, where teams can smoothly scale collaboration on components to many developers and applications. Developers can host, discover, and share components while continuously releasing small updates to everyone in the organization. Everything is free for open-source developers.

Modularity benefits almost every part of the development process, from [accelerating releases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDjTcBKXKDE) to making debugging or refactoring much simpler. For teams, Bit is often used as a solution for a verity of [use-cases](https://blog.bitsrc.io/4-bit-use-cases-build-like-the-best-teams-1c36560c7c6e) such as Micro Frontends, Design Systems, Delivery Speed, and Collaboration on components.

## Large scale example of building with Bit

Bit is 100% built with Bit! Every feature in Bit, from the [Bit Version Manager](https://bit.dev/teambit/bvm) to the workspace UI and even [supporting MDX](https://bit.dev/teambit/mdx), are just scopes of components developed with Bit.

Explore [dozens of OSS scopes and hundreds of OSS components](https://bit.dev/teambit) on Bit's cloud platform.
